The Proverbial "Unconsciousness"

i was already aware
i had understood fully

i saw the devil
i was perfectly still
involuntarily i paused

there said i:
my sheer consciousness
of certain given circumstances
i noticed
it's nothing
     nothing
     nothing any man wouldn't learn

a way of finding these
i know not

nothing common or typical
and yet (somehow)
very little thought
will normally resolve every contradiction

a foolish heart -> an eternal misfortune
